(*Eng*) The middle man

> There was a man with a pencil in the middle. Middle of what? Who knows? He always felt like this without any idea for reason. He was brought up in a conservative family that potentially was in the heart of his life. But he doesn't want to remember that days anymore. He knows how he felt after expelling from the school and being like in ledge of family. His father was like a sheer wall for every discussion and preventing him to shape his own way. Maybe that was because of buzzing news about war and bad economy, but there should have been more. He have never known that, because after staying in the zone and harworking he got the foot in the door of university and left them behind. He hasn't looked back after this moment and flashed around country with his exam scores. Everyone were stunned, because it was impossible to flawlessly work in that conditions. It was merely small possibility to rally after these long period of indolence life. But they had forgetten how greasy he is for his decisions and after deciding his way how hard to change his mind. Finally we was at the summit of Mount Blanc and has just singed the summit book. But he was standing on his plented steps in the middle of a low surrounding.

>There was a man with a pencil in the middle of foreigners. They had come from far but he was from the city. Unlike others, he felt fatigue in the middle of way but he rallied by staying in the zone and pushing toward the his limits. At the end, these bad feelings turned into to being stunned due to accomplishment of this goal. Because, it was a merely impossible dream for someone in that age. After he explained his decision all family members warned him about how this event potentially can kill him. They said that he was in the heart of family and he shouldn't do that. However, it was not true and he felt like he is on the ledge of family until this moment. Now he was standing over planted steps in the summit. This was the point he got his foot in the door of climbing and becaming the oldest person who climbed to Mount Blanc. The news was buzzing this journey and it flashed around the world.

>The old man was fainted due to lack of sleep and fatique. Because, he had already sick. Writing and staying in the zone for several hours were potentially dangerous. The doctor and all family members warned him but when he get his foot in the door of writing it was impossible to stop him. He was a famous writer and had flashed around the world once upon a time. So, even getting stuck in some points he rallied to finish this book before the party. The book was supposed to be a birthday gift in the next day. There was merely small time before party and the book was completed. Everything were working flawlessly according to his plan. The girl would be stunned when she see the book had written for her. The old man closed the book and named the book by using one of greasy tags.He wasn't aware that this name will have been buzzing in the news in the next day. Because it was the last book of a great writer who was in the summit of his career. During his long and successful journey he hasn't looked back but it was time to rest. By this book, an old saying brought up again. There is no reward without taking risk.
